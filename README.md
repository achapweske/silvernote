## About

SilverNote is a note taking application I created while I was in medical school. I tried using other applications with overlapping features, but none had all the capabilities I needed in a single program - especially when it comes to creating drawings and searching my notes. I'm now releasing this as free open source software so that others can benefit from it as well. I hope you Enjoy!
